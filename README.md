# Consumer Complaints
## This project aims to analyze consumer complaints from a specific dataset to uncover underlying sentiments using natural language processing techniques. By employing sentiment analysis, we aim to categorize complaints into various sentiment classes, enabling us to understand consumer sentiment trends towards products or services.

## Data Cleaning üßπ

 The data cleaning process includes adjusting blank cells, ensuring proper date formats, and preparing the text data for analysis.
 
### Adjusting Blank Cells
To maintain data consistency and facilitate analysis, blank cells in several columns are replaced with "N/A".
```
complaints$ZIP.code <- as.numeric(complaints$ZIP.code)
complaints$Consumer.consent.provided. <- ifelse(complaints$Consumer.consent.provided. == "", "N/A",complaints$Consumer.consent.provided.)
complaints$Sub.product <- ifelse(complaints$Sub.product == "", "N/A",complaints$Sub.product)
complaints$Sub.issue<- ifelse(complaints$Sub.issue == "", "N/A",complaints$Sub.issue)
complaints$Consumer.complaint.narrative <- ifelse(complaints$Consumer.complaint.narrative == "", "N/A",complaints$Consumer.complaint.narrative)
complaints$Company.public.response <- ifelse(complaints$Company.public.response == "", "N/A",complaints$Company.public.response)
complaints$Tags<- ifelse(complaints$Tags == "", "N/A",complaints$Tags)
complaints$Consumer.disputed.<- ifelse(complaints$Consumer.disputed. == "", "N/A",complaints$Consumer.disputed.)
```
### Ensuring Proper Date Formats
Dates are formatted to ensure consistency and ease of analysis, converting them from character strings to Date objects using lubridate.
```
consumer_complaints$`Date received` <- as.Date(consumer_complaints$`Date received`, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
consumer_complaints$`Date sent to company` <- as.Date(consumer_complaints$`Date sent to company`, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
```
### Preparing Text Data for Analysis
The 'Consumer complaint narrative' column, essential for sentiment analysis, is preprocessed to remove NA values and ensure it contains character strings. This preprocessing is vital for the tokenization process in sentiment analysis.
```
consumer_complaints <- consumer_complaints %>%
  filter(!is.na(`Consumer complaint narrative`), `Consumer complaint narrative` != "") %>%
  mutate(`Consumer complaint narrative` = as.character(`Consumer complaint narrative`))
```
